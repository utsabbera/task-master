# Commit Message Guidelines

When writing commit messages, please follow these guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency:

1. **Use the imperative mood**: Write your commit messages as if you are giving commands. For example, use "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adding feature".
2. **Be concise but descriptive**: Keep your commit messages short, ideally under 50 characters for the subject line, but provide enough detail to understand the change.
3. **Capitalize the first letter**: Start your commit message with a capital letter.
4. **Use the body for additional context**: If necessary, include a body in your commit message to explain the "why" behind the change. This should be wrapped at 72 characters and in list format.

## Format:

```
Commit title

- Followed by detailed description on next lines
```

## Example:

```
Add get accounts api

- Add new auth middleware for get api
- Rename model accounts to account
```
